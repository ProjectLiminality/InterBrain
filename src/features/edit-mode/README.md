# Edit Mode Feature

Unified editing interface that integrates metadata editing with relationship management in the focused view context. This feature represents the completion of Epic 4, combining spatial orchestration, relationship management, and semantic search integration.

## Components

### EditNode3D
- **Purpose**: In-space metadata editing UI extending ProtoNode3D patterns
- **Features**: Title editing, type selection, DreamTalk media management
- **Integration**: Pre-populated with existing DreamNode data for editing context
- **Patterns**: Reuses ProtoNode3D validation, animation, and interaction patterns

## Key Features

### Metadata Editing
- **Title Changes**: Live editing with debounced validation and store updates
- **Type Changes**: Dream ↔ Dreamer switching with relationship impact warnings
- **DreamTalk Media**: File drag-drop and selection for media updates
- **Validation**: Same validation patterns as ProtoNode creation

### Relationship Management  
- **Honeycomb Layout**: Existing relationships shown with gold glow indicators
- **Semantic Search**: Population of empty slots with opposite-type suggestions
- **Click-to-Toggle**: Transform search results into relationships via visual feedback
- **Real-time Preview**: Spatial layout updates during relationship editing

### User Experience
- **Entry**: Available when node is centered in liminal web layout
- **Commands**: Command palette driven for keyboard-first workflow
- **Exit**: Save/cancel workflow preserving original state on cancel
- **Integration**: Seamless with existing spatial navigation and undo/redo

## Technical Architecture

### Store Integration
- **State Management**: Dedicated EditModeState in Zustand store
- **Original Preservation**: Store original relationships for cancel operations  
- **Pending Changes**: Track relationship modifications before persistence
- **Search Results**: Manage semantic search results for relationship discovery

### Semantic Search Integration
- **Type Filtering**: Automatic opposite-type filtering (Dream ↔ Dreamer)
- **Search Commands**: Text-based and similarity-based relationship discovery
- **Performance**: Background indexing and non-blocking operations
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful degradation when semantic search unavailable

### Service Layer
- **Persistence**: Leverage existing DreamNodeService for metadata updates
- **Bidirectional**: Relationship updates propagated to all connected nodes
- **Git Integration**: Existing git workflow patterns for change tracking
- **Mock/Real**: Compatible with both development modes

## Commands

- `enter-edit-mode` - Activate edit mode for centered node
- `exit-edit-mode` - Exit without saving changes
- `search-related-nodes` - Text-based semantic search for relationships
- `find-similar-related-nodes` - Similarity-based relationship suggestions
- `save-edit-mode-changes` - Persist all changes and exit
- `cancel-edit-mode-changes` - Discard changes and exit

## Integration Points

- **ProtoNode System**: Extends creation UI for editing context
- **Spatial Orchestration**: Uses focused layout as editing foundation
- **Semantic Search**: Epic 5 integration for intelligent relationship discovery
- **Command System**: Follows existing command palette infrastructure
- **Animation System**: Consistent with existing spatial movement patterns

## Future Extensions

- **Advanced Validation**: Relationship constraint checking
- **Bulk Operations**: Multi-node relationship management
- **History Integration**: Edit mode specific undo/redo
- **Media Management**: Enhanced DreamTalk media editing capabilities
- **Template Integration**: Git template updates during metadata changes
