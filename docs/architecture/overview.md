Of course. This is an excellent and crucial point in your development process. You've correctly identified the central tension between traditional front-end architectures optimized for component reusability (Layered/Atomic) and modern architectures optimized for AI context and maintainability (Vertical Slice).

Let's synthesize the insights from both answers and forge a definitive architectural guide for your InterBrain project. The goal is to create a document that is not only clear for you but can be pasted directly into your AI assistant's context window to ensure every development session starts with a shared understanding of "how we build things here."

### **ARCHITECTURE.md: A Guide for AI-First Development of InterBrain**

#### **1. Core Philosophy: AI Readability >= Human Readability**

Software engineering is changing. Our primary collaborator is increasingly an AI assistant. Traditional architectures, like the **Layered Architecture**, were designed to help humans manage complexity by grouping files by their *technical type* (`components`, `hooks`, `services`). While this works, it scatters the context for any single feature across the entire codebase, making it difficult and token-expensive for an AI to grasp.

Our goal is to adopt a **Pragmatic Hybrid Architecture** that combines three powerful concepts:

1.  **Command Palette Abstraction:** All backend operations are exposed as Obsidian commands, creating a clean separation between UI and business logic.
2.  **Vertical Slice Architecture:** We organize our code by **feature**, not by technical type. Everything a feature needs to function (its UI, state, logic) lives in a single, self-contained folder.
3.  **Atomic Design Principles:** For UI elements that are truly shared across multiple features (like a generic button or modal), we maintain a separate, shared component library.

This hybrid approach gives us the best of both worlds: extreme token efficiency when working on a specific feature, clean abstraction between frontend and backend, and a robust system for reusable, foundational UI.

#### **2. The Project Structure**

Here is the definitive folder structure for the InterBrain Obsidian plugin. This structure is designed to be self-explanatory for both human and AI developers.

#### **3. The Development Workflow: Rules of the Game**

To maintain architectural coherence, we will follow these rules when developing:

**Rule #1: Commands Before UI.**
Before building any UI component, create the command palette commands it will use. Start with stub commands that log what would happen, then build the UI to call those commands.

**Rule #2: Service Layer Abstraction.**
Commands delegate to services, never perform git operations directly. Services handle the actual business logic and can be tested independently.

**Rule #3: UI Calls Commands.**
UI components use `this.app.commands.executeCommandById()` to trigger operations. Never call services directly from UI - always go through the command palette.

**Rule #4: Default to the Feature Slice.**
When creating a new component, hook, or utility, always create it *inside the folder of the feature it belongs to*. For example, a new button for managing Git history goes in `/features/git-history/GitButton.tsx`. This keeps features highly cohesive and AI-friendly by default.

**Rule #5: Promote to Shared Only on Second Use.**
Do not abstract prematurely. Only when you need to use a component in a *second* feature should you "promote" it to the shared `/components` directory. The process is a simple refactoring task perfect for an AI: "Take `/features/git-history/GitButton.tsx`, move it to `/components/atoms/Button.tsx`, make its props generic, and update the import paths."

**Rule #6: The `/dreamspace` is for Core Spatial Logic.**
The `/dreamspace` folder is special. It is not a user-facing feature; it is the fundamental "engine" of the application. It contains the 3D canvas, camera controls, and the base logic for rendering and interacting with nodes and edges. UI panels that *interact with* the dreamspace (like a details panel) are considered separate features and belong in the `/features` directory.

**Rule #7: Document for the AI.**
Every feature folder in `/features/` should contain a `README.md`. This file will serve as a high-level summary for the AI.

*Example `/features/repo-management/README.md`:*
`This feature handles all repository management tasks. It provides a UI (RepoPanel.tsx) for users to create, rename, and bundle DreamNodes. It calls commands like 'interbrain:create-dreamnode' and 'interbrain:weave-dreams' which delegate to the GitService for actual operations.`

#### **4. Command Palette Integration Patterns**

**Command Registration:**
```typescript
// In main.ts
this.addCommand({
  id: 'save-dreamnode',
  name: 'Save DreamNode',
  callback: async () => {
    const node = this.getCurrentDreamNode();
    await this.services.git.commitWithAI(node);
    this.services.ui.showSuccess('DreamNode saved');
  }
});
```

**UI Integration:**
```typescript
// In React components
const handleSave = () => {
  // @ts-ignore - Obsidian app is available globally
  app.commands.executeCommandById('interbrain:save-dreamnode');
};
```

**Service Layer:**
```typescript
// Services handle actual business logic
export class GitService {
  async commitWithAI(dreamNode: DreamNode) {
    const message = await this.generateCommitMessage(dreamNode);
    await this.executeShellCommand(`git commit -m "${message}"`);
  }
}
```

This workflow gives you a clear, powerful, and token-efficient way to build your application, leveraging the strengths of your AI assistant at every step. It respects the interconnected nature of your front-end while providing clean abstraction between UI and backend operations through the command palette.
