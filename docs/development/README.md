# Development Documentation

This section contains development planning, processes, and organizational documentation.

## Documents

- [**Roadmap**](roadmap.md) - 3-month development timeline and milestones

## Project Tracking

All development now happens through **GitHub Issues and Project Boards**:

- **GitHub Issues**: [InterBrainMVP Issues](https://github.com/ProjectLiminality/InterBrainMVP/issues) - Detailed specifications with parent-child relationships
- **GitHub Project**: [InterBrain Development](https://github.com/users/ProjectLiminality/projects/2) - Strategic Epic-level workflow tracking
- **Sub-issue Navigation**: Native GitHub feature shows hierarchy and progress

## Development Philosophy

### Wave-Like Development
InterBrain follows a **wave-like development workflow** where high-level features flow into detailed specifications, then into implementation:

- **Wave 1**: Foundation (Plugin Infrastructure, 3D Visualization, DreamNode Management, Git Operations)
- **Wave 2**: Core Features (Semantic Search, Basic Video)
- **Wave 3**: Advanced Features (Full DreamWalk, Coherence Beacon, DreamOS Operations)
- **Wave 4**: Polish & Launch (Onboarding, Testing Infrastructure)

### 4-Tier Issue Hierarchy (AI-Centered)
- **Epics**: High-level vision for major feature areas (12 items)
- **Specifications**: Detailed technical design documents (12 items)  
- **Features**: Essential implementation chunks (27 items)
- **Tasks**: Generated dynamically during development (0 predefined)

**Total: 51 structured development items** managed through GitHub Issues with native parent-child relationships.

### AI-Centered Development Integration
- **Dynamic Task Generation**: Tasks created just-in-time based on current development context
- **Reduced Cognitive Overhead**: Only essential features preserved, eliminating AI-generated filler
- **Wave-Based Development**: Detail emerges as development waves hit each area
- **AI Pair-Programming Ready**: Clean structure optimized for AI collaboration
