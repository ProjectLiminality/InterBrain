## Development Philosophy

### Wave-Like Development
InterBrain follows a **wave-like development workflow** where high-level features flow into detailed specifications, then into implementation:

- **Wave 1**: Foundation (Plugin Infrastructure, 3D Visualization, DreamNode Management, Git Operations)
- **Wave 2**: Core Features (Semantic Search, Basic Video)
- **Wave 3**: Advanced Features (Full DreamWalk, Coherence Beacon, DreamOS Operations)
- **Wave 4**: Polish & Launch (Onboarding, Testing Infrastructure)

### 4-Tier Issue Hierarchy
- **Epics**: High-level vision for major feature areas
- **Specifications**: Detailed technical design documents
- **Features**: Concrete implementation chunks
- **Tasks**: Atomic work units (1-3 days each)

### Professional Development Integration
- **Testing**: Every Feature includes unit testing tasks
- **Documentation**: Every Feature includes documentation update tasks
- **AI Collaboration**: Issues structured for optimal AI assistant comprehension
