# InterBrain Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for **InterBrain** - an innovative knowledge management system that transcends traditional "Second Brain" paradigms.

## Quick Navigation

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture
- [**Overview**](architecture/overview.md) - Technical architecture and design philosophy
- [**Git User Experience**](architecture/git-user-experience.md) - How we make git accessible to everyone

### üöÄ Development
- [**Roadmap**](development/roadmap.md) - 3-month development plan
- [**Issue Hierarchy**](development/issue-hierarchy.md) - Project structure and relationships
- [**Development Kanban**](development/kanban.md) - Complete development items (163 items)

## What is InterBrain?

The InterBrain is evolving from a standalone Electron app to a native Obsidian plugin, ultimately forming the foundation for DreamOS - a decentralized, AI-powered operating system for collective sensemaking.

### Core Concepts
- **Dream Nodes**: Git repositories representing either ideas (Dreams) or people (Dreamers)
- **Dream Talk**: Concise, symbolic representations of ideas
- **Dream Song**: Elaborate explanations with references to other Dream Talks
- **Liminal Web**: Self-organizing knowledge based on social relationships
