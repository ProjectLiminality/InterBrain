# Partial Epic Merge Documentation

## Date: December 17, 2024
## Epic: Epic 4 - Liminal Web Layout System

## Executive Summary

This document records a workflow exception where Epic 4 was partially merged to main before full completion. This exception was necessary due to architectural circular dependencies between Epic 4 and Epic 5.

## Rationale for Partial Merge

### The Circular Dependency
1. **Epic 4's Edit Mode (#321)** requires semantic search functionality to provide a refined user experience for finding and adding related nodes
2. **Epic 5's Semantic Search** requires Epic 4's spatial orchestration system as its foundation
3. The dependency exists at the epic level but not at the feature level - specific features can be cleanly separated

### Why This Exception Makes Sense
- The spatial orchestration system (#316) and undo/redo navigation (#320) are complete, tested, and stable
- These features form a coherent foundation that Epic 5 genuinely needs
- Keeping Epic 4 branch open while developing Epic 5 would create merge conflicts and complexity
- This mirrors real-world software development where foundational features often ship before full epic completion

## What Was Merged

### Completed Features (Merged to Main)
1. **Feature #316**: Focused Layout Engine & Spatial Orchestration System
   - Universal Movement API with advanced easing
   - SpatialOrchestrator centralizing all spatial interactions
   - World-space quaternion mathematics for rotation-aware positioning
   - Dual-mode positioning system (constellation vs active modes)

2. **Feature #320**: Undo/Redo Navigation with Mid-Flight Animation Interruption
   - Navigation History System with Command+Z/Shift+Z
   - Ultra-lightweight history storage
   - Seamless animation interruption with mid-flight position capture

### Deferred Feature (Not Merged)
1. **Feature #321**: Unified Edit Mode - DreamNode Metadata and Relationship Editor
   - Will be implemented after Epic 5 completion
   - Will leverage semantic search for relationship management
   - Tracked in GitHub issue with clear continuation requirements

## Continuation Plan

### Timeline
1. **Now**: Merge Epic 4 foundation to main
2. **Next**: Develop Epic 5 (Semantic Search) using spatial orchestration foundation
3. **After Epic 5**: Create `epic/4-continued` branch from main
4. **Final**: Implement Edit Mode with semantic search integration

### Branch Strategy
```
main (with Epic 4 foundation)
  ├── epic/5-semantic-search (current development)
  └── epic/4-continued (future - after Epic 5)
```

### Deferred Housekeeping Tasks
The following Epic 4 completion tasks are deferred until `epic/4-continued` is complete:
- Full CHANGELOG.md update with complete Epic 4 details
- Comprehensive documentation updates in docs/
- Version bump and release tag
- Final integration testing of all Epic 4 features together
- Epic 4 GitHub issue closure

## Tracking and Memory

### GitHub Issues
- **Epic 4 (#255)**: Updated with partial completion status, remains OPEN
- **Edit Mode (#321)**: Updated with dependency on Epic 5, clear continuation requirements
- **Epic 5 (#256)**: Will reference spatial orchestration availability

### Project Memory
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated with partial merge status and continuation plan
- **README.md**: Updated to reflect foundation complete, edit mode pending
- **This file**: Permanent record of the exception and rationale

## Success Criteria for Continuation

When returning to `epic/4-continued`, success requires:
1. Epic 5's semantic search is complete and merged
2. Edit Mode integrates semantic search seamlessly
3. All original Epic 4 acceptance criteria are met
4. Full housekeeping tasks are completed
5. Epic 4 issue is closed with complete summary

## Lessons and Patterns

This exception establishes a pattern for handling architectural circular dependencies:
1. Identify genuine architectural dependencies early
2. Complete and test foundational features thoroughly
3. Document the exception comprehensively
4. Create clear continuation plan before proceeding
5. Track all deferred work explicitly

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks
1. **Forgetting to complete Epic 4**: Mitigated by extensive documentation and open GitHub issue
2. **Confusion about workflow**: Mitigated by this document and CLAUDE.md updates
3. **Merge conflicts in continuation**: Mitigated by merging foundation now rather than later

### Safeguards
- GitHub issue #255 remains open as a reminder
- CLAUDE.md has prominent warning section
- Clear branch naming convention (epic/4-continued)
- This document serves as permanent record

**Authorization**: This exception was consciously decided after careful consideration of the architectural dependencies and development momentum. The decision prioritizes pragmatic progress while maintaining clear documentation and continuation planning.
