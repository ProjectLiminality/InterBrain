# Local Testing Guide: Collaboration Handshake

## What We Built Today

We've implemented the complete collaboration handshake system for DreamNode sharing via Radicle links. Here's what happens when you click a share link:

### Single Link Flow
```
obsidian://interbrain-clone?id=rad:z123...&senderDid=did:key:z6Mk...&senderName=Alice
```

**What happens automatically:**
1. ‚úÖ Clone DreamNode from Radicle network
2. ‚úÖ Automatically run `rad follow <SENDER_DID>` (enables update propagation)
3. ‚úÖ Create Dreamer node for "Alice" (if doesn't exist)
4. ‚úÖ Save Alice's DID to Dreamer node's `.udd` file
5. ‚úÖ Link cloned DreamNode to Alice's Dreamer node
6. ‚úÖ Focus on cloned DreamNode in liminal-web layout
7. ‚úÖ Alice appears as related node

### Batch Link Flow
```
obsidian://interbrain-clone-batch?ids=rad:z123,rad:z456&senderDid=did:key:z6Mk...&senderName=Alice
```

**What happens automatically:**
1. ‚úÖ Clone all DreamNodes from Radicle network
2. ‚úÖ Automatically follow Alice's DID once
3. ‚úÖ Create Dreamer node for "Alice" (if doesn't exist)
4. ‚úÖ Link ALL cloned DreamNodes to Alice's Dreamer node
5. üîÑ **TODO**: Focus on Alice's Dreamer node (showing all shared nodes around her)

### Duplicate Detection
- ‚úÖ If Alice's Dreamer node already exists (detected by DID), reuse it
- ‚úÖ If DreamNode already cloned, skip and just focus it
- ‚úÖ Multiple links from same person ‚Üí one Dreamer node

## How to Test Locally

### Setup (One Time)

1. **Build the latest code:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/davidrug/DreamGarden/InterBrain
   git pull origin main
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Reload InterBrain in Obsidian:**
   - Use Plugin Reloader hotkey, OR
   - Toggle InterBrain off/on in Settings

3. **Verify Radicle is running:**
   ```bash
   rad node status
   # Should show "Running"

   # If not:
   rad node start
   ```

4. **Add Radicle key to ssh-agent (CRITICAL for non-interactive operations):**
   ```bash
   # Add your Radicle key to ssh-agent
   ssh-add ~/.radicle/keys/radicle
   # You'll be prompted for passphrase ONCE

   # Verify it's loaded:
   ssh-add -l
   # Should show your Radicle key
   ```

   **Why this is needed**: InterBrain runs `rad init` and other commands non-interactively (from within Obsidian). Without ssh-agent, these commands fail with "please set `RAD_PASSPHRASE`" error.

5. **Get your Radicle identity:**
   ```bash
   rad self --did
   # Example: did:key:z6MkxyzABC123...

   rad self --alias
   # Example: David
   ```

### Test Scenario 1: Generate Share Link

1. **Select a DreamNode** in InterBrain
2. **Run Command**: `Copy Share Link for Selected DreamNode`
   - Opens command palette (Cmd+P)
   - Type "Copy Share Link"
   - Press Enter

3. **Check clipboard:**
   - Paste into a text editor
   - Should see: `obsidian://interbrain-clone?id=rad:z123...&senderDid=did:key:z6Mk...&senderName=YourName`

4. **What happened behind the scenes:**
   - Checked if node has Radicle ID
   - If not, ran `rad init` automatically
   - Generated link with your DID and name included

### Test Scenario 2: Single Link Handshake

1. **Create a test link manually:**
   ```
   obsidian://interbrain-clone?id=rad:z32KcCXgBC7ijWnQA6cHU5Frm9QwW&senderDid=did:key:z6MktestABC&senderName=TestFriend
   ```

2. **Click the link in your browser**

3. **Watch Obsidian console** (Cmd+Option+I ‚Üí Console):
   ```
   üîó [URIHandler] Single clone request
   ü§ù [URIHandler] Starting collaboration handshake for TestFriend
   üë§ [URIHandler] Creating new Dreamer node for TestFriend
   ‚úÖ [URIHandler] Saved DID to Dreamer node
   üîó [URIHandler] Linked "YourDreamNode" to "TestFriend"
   ‚úÖ [URIHandler] Collaboration handshake complete
   ```

4. **Verify in DreamSpace:**
   - Cloned DreamNode should be selected
   - In liminal-web layout, "TestFriend" Dreamer node should appear as related
   - Select TestFriend node ‚Üí should show connection to cloned node

5. **Verify in file system:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/vault/TestFriend
   cat .udd | grep radicleId
   # Should show: "radicleId": "did:key:z6MktestABC"
   ```

### Test Scenario 3: Duplicate Detection

1. **Click the SAME link again**

2. **Expected behavior:**
   - "DreamNode already cloned" message
   - Just focuses existing node
   - Does NOT create duplicate Dreamer node
   - TestFriend Dreamer node still has same DID

3. **Verify:**
   ```bash
   # Should be only ONE TestFriend directory:
   ls /path/to/vault | grep TestFriend
   ```

### Test Scenario 4: Multiple Nodes from Same Person

1. **Share TWO different DreamNodes** (using Copy Share Link command)

2. **Send both links** to your test account (or paste in browser)

3. **Click first link, then second link**

4. **Expected behavior:**
   - First click: Creates TestFriend Dreamer node
   - Second click: Reuses SAME TestFriend Dreamer node
   - Both DreamNodes linked to TestFriend

5. **Verify in DreamSpace:**
   - Select TestFriend ‚Üí both cloned nodes appear as related

### Test Scenario 5: Batch Link

1. **Create a batch link manually:**
   ```
   obsidian://interbrain-clone-batch?ids=rad:z123,rad:z456&senderDid=did:key:z6MktestABC&senderName=TestFriend
   ```

2. **Click the batch link**

3. **Expected behavior:**
   - Progress notification shows "Cloning 2 DreamNodes..."
   - Both nodes clone sequentially
   - TestFriend Dreamer node created once
   - Both nodes linked to TestFriend
   - üîÑ **Currently**: Last cloned node gets focus
   - ‚ú® **Goal**: TestFriend Dreamer node gets focus (TODO)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] "Copy Share Link" command works
- [ ] Generated link includes your DID and name
- [ ] Clicking link clones node successfully
- [ ] Dreamer node created automatically
- [ ] DID saved to Dreamer node's .udd file
- [ ] Cloned node linked to Dreamer node
- [ ] Duplicate click doesn't recreate Dreamer node
- [ ] Multiple nodes from same person use same Dreamer node
- [ ] Batch link clones all nodes
- [ ] Batch link creates one Dreamer node for all
- [ ] Automatic peer following works (check console for "‚úÖ Collaboration handshake complete")

---

## Debugging Tips

### If Dreamer node not created:

Check console for errors:
```
‚ùå [URIHandler] Collaboration handshake failed
```

Common causes:
- Node creation failed (permissions?)
- .udd file couldn't be updated
- DreamNodeService not initialized

### If link doesn't include DID:

Check console:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è [ShareLink] Could not get Radicle identity
```

Fixes:
```bash
# Verify Radicle identity exists:
rad self --did

# If not:
rad auth
```

### If nodes not linking:

Check console:
```
‚ùå [URIHandler] Failed to link nodes
```

Common causes:
- DreamSongRelationshipService error
- Git operations failed
- Node not found after clone

---

## What's Next

### Remaining Implementation:
1. **Batch focus behavior**: Focus on Dreamer node instead of last cloned node
2. **Better notifications**: Show Dreamer node name in success message
3. **Email export testing**: Test with actual email workflow

### Future Enhancements (Post-Test):
1. **Bidirectional handshake**: Receiver sends their DID back to sender
2. **Batch optimizations**: Parallel cloning instead of sequential
3. **Progress indicators**: Real-time progress for batch operations
4. **Conflict resolution**: Handle name collisions gracefully

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Minimum Success:**

- Focus behavior correct
- No console errors

üåü **Excellence:**
- All above, PLUS:
- Smooth UX, no lag
