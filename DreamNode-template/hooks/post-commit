# DreamNode Post-Commit Hook  
# Part of InterBrain DreamNode Template System
#
# PURPOSE: Coherence Beacon Relationship Tracking
#
# FUTURE FUNCTIONALITY (Placeholder Implementation):
# - Detects when a commit includes submodule changes
# - Updates bidirectional relationship tracking in UDD files
# - When DreamNode A imports DreamNode B as submodule:
#   * DreamNode A knows about the submodule (git handles this)
#   * DreamNode B gets updated to know it's used as submodule in A
# - Enables peer-to-peer discovery via Radicle network
# - Maintains coherent relationship graph across distributed network
#
# This hook fires AFTER each commit to update relationship metadata
# based on what was actually committed.
#
# CURRENT STATUS: Placeholder - no-op to prevent git operation failures  
# IMPLEMENTATION: Deferred until coherence beacon features

echo "DreamNode Post-Commit Hook: Coherence beacon relationship tracking (placeholder)"

# Get current commit hash
COMMIT_HASH=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
echo "Processing commit: $COMMIT_HASH"

# Future implementation will:
# 1. Check if commit includes .gitmodules changes
# 2. Identify newly added submodules
# 3. For each new submodule:
#    - Get submodule's UUID from its .udd file
#    - Update this node's .udd submodules array
#    - Update submodule's .udd supermodules array  
#    - Create commit in submodule repo with relationship update
# 4. Propagate changes via Radicle network

# For now, allow commit to complete normally
