# DreamNode Post-Commit Hook
# Part of InterBrain DreamNode Template System
#
# STATUS: Placeholder - Currently Unused
#
# FUTURE PURPOSE: Generic Coherence Beacon Relationship Tracking
# This hook could be activated in the future to handle relationship tracking
# for commits that happen OUTSIDE of the "Sync Canvas Submodules" command.
#
# CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION:
# Bidirectional supermodule/submodule tracking is handled directly in the
# SubmoduleManagerService.syncCanvasSubmodules() method. This provides:
# - Immediate feedback during sync operations
# - Simpler debugging (all logic in one place)
# - Better error handling and logging
#
# POTENTIAL FUTURE USE:
# If we need to track relationships from manual git operations or
# other workflows, the logic from hook-helper.js can be reactivated here.
#
# For now, this hook is a no-op placeholder.

# Silently exit - no logging needed for placeholder
